# BaimsLandingPageAnimation
This project is owned by Baims.

This project was developed in 8 hours to make sure the animation mockup is doable on iOS and can be applied. This is a separate project than Baims. So, ehancements to the code architecture has been done when imported to the real app.

PLEASE NOTE: this project has a very bad code archeticture. It is just for FUN & EDUCATION.
